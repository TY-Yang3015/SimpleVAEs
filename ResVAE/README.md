# TensorFlow-ResVAE

This is a simple and flexible implementation of the framework of a convolutional variational autoencoder with residual blocks. 

Put training image data (expect (128 x 128)) into the `./binary` and `./continuous` folders.

All changable parameters can be accessed from the `cVAE-Main.py` file except the beta parameter on the reconstruction loss component.
